## The Other, or how to peel a banana (2020)

{% include youtube.html video="0wr2DRr0F6I" %}

<br />

With this work, I tried to depict my relationship with the US since arriving here 8 years ago. The initial cultural shock gradually faded away and now, many things that I considered foreign and weird are very familiar. This led me to question whether the construction of "others" is just something we create in our heads to explain the unfamiliar, when in fact the "other" is someone much more similar to me than I previously thought. And this reflection led me to rethink the preconceptions I have towards people I have met and places I have been. (Special thanks to Dr. Lawrence and my colleagues from the Ethnomusicology class, which was the place where this project came about).
